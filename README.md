Exposé on how to create an information network based on reliable sources. Peer-to-peer communication is the essence  of nowadays’'s information distribution. User generated content is _the new journalism_. As it is noticeable, **misinformation is a problem** that deserves tackling. Who should be the instance of such a responsibility influence able  by biased opinions, preferences, interests, hidden agendas, etc.?**Nobody!**

**Nobody!** There’'s a way to break down each comment containing information to it’'s very core values and inputs.

There's no reason to censor/discriminate against people putting information into their network of choice. What if automation could reward good research, a traceable source and positive community enforcement. What if there was a way to prevent blind belief in unreachable _influencers_ and users in general?

Given the chance to implement such ideas, what would happen to the information ecosystem? Reliable information is an asset to everybody, public or private. The journalists, correspondents  and news agencies could find a new fresh approach for distribution as well as political and social apathy could be addressed by creating a direct path to reliable and edited content.
