<p align="center">Exposé on how to create an information network based on reliable sources. </p>
Peer-to-peer communication is the essence and the beauty in nowadays’s information distribution. User generated content is the new journalism. As it is noticeable, misinformation in Social Media is a problem that deserves tackling. How should this be done? How can we get rid of biased opinions, preferences, interests, hidden agendas, etc.?

**Nobody, as a individual** should have such a responsibility. There’s a way to break down each comment containing information to it’s very core values and inputs. Then fitting sources can be matched to the content, fully automatic. 

There's no reason to censor or discriminate against people putting information into their network of choice. What if automation could reward good research, a traceable source and positive community enforcement. What if there was a way to prevent blind belief in unreachable _influencers_ and users in general? We want to be sure, that what we read is true, after all.

Given the chance to implement such ideas, what would happen to the information ecosystem? Reliable information is an asset to everybody, public or private. The journalists, correspondents  and news agencies could find a new fresh approach for distribution. Political and social apathy could be addressed by creating a direct path to reliable and edited content. 

**What are we waiting for?**
